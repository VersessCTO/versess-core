Versess Coin version *version* is now available from:  <https://github.com/versess-project/versess/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github: <https://github.com/versess-project/versess/issues>


Mandatory Update
==============


How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Versess-Qt (on Mac) or versessd/versess-qt (on Linux).


Compatibility
==============

Versess Coin is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.10+, and Windows 7 and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues. Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Apple released it's last Mountain Lion update August 13, 2015, and officially ended support on [December 14, 2015](http://news.fnal.gov/2015/10/mac-os-x-mountain-lion-10-8-end-of-life-december-14/). Versess Coin software starting with v3.2.0 will no longer run on MacOS versions prior to Yosemite (10.10). Please do not report issues about MacOS versions prior to Yosemite to the issue tracker.

Versess Coin should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

 
Notable Changes
==============

## zVERS Public Spends

Recent exploits of the Zerocoin protocol (Wrapped serials and broken P1 proof) required us to enable the zerocoin spork and deactivate zVERS functionality in order to secure the supply until the pertinent review process was completed.

Moving forward from this undesired situation, we are enabling a secure and chain storage friendly solution for the zerocoin public spend (aka zVERS to VERS conversion).

The explanation of how this works can be found in #891

After block `1,880,000` has past, `SPORK_16` will be deactivated to allow zVERS spends to occur using this new public spend method for version 2 zVERS (version 1 zVERS won't be spendable, see note below). zVERS public spends, as the name suggests, are **NOT** private, they reveal the input mint that is being spent. The minting of **NEW** zVERS, as well as zVERS staking will remain disabled for the time being.

It is advised that users spend/convert their existing zVERS to VERS, which can be done via the GUI or RPC as it was prior to the disabling of zVERS. Note that with the public spend method, the restriction on the number of denominations per transaction (previously 7) has been lifted, and now allows for several hundred denominations per transaction.

*Note on version 1 zVERS*: Version 1 zVERS was only available to me minted between versions v3.0.0 (Oct 6, 2017) and v3.1.0 (May 8, 2018). The announcement that version 1 zVERS was deprecated went out on May 1, 2018 with a recommendation for users to spend/convert their version 1 zVERS.

Version 1 zVERS will be made spendable at a later date due to the extra work required in order to make these version 1 mints spendable.

## GUI Changes

### Options Dialog Cleanup

The options/settings UI dialog has been cleaned up to no longer show settings that are wallet related when running in "disable wallet" (`-disablewallet`) mode.

### Privacy Tab

Notice text has been added to the privacy tab indicating that zVERS minting is disabled, as well as the removal of UI elements that supported such functionality. Notice text has also been added indicating that zVERS spends are currently **NOT** private.

## RPC Changes

### Removal of Deprecated Commands

The `masternode` and `mnbudget` RPC commands, which were marked as deprecated in Versess Coin v2.3.1 (September 19, 2017), have now been completely removed from Versess Coin.

Several new commands were added in v2.3.1 to replace the two aforementioned commands, reference the [v2.3.1 Release Notes](https://github.com/Versess-Project/Versess/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-2.3.1.md#rpc-changes) for further details.

### New `getblockindexstats` Command

A new RPC command (`getblockindexstats`) has been introduced which serves the purpose of obtaining statistical information on a range of blocks. The information returned is as follows:
  * transaction count (not including coinbase/coinstake txes)
  * transaction count (including coinbase/coinstake txes)
  * zVERS per-denom mint count
  * zVERS per-denom spend count
  * total transaction bytes
  * total fees in block range
  * average fee per kB

Command Reference:
```$xslt
getblockindexstats height range ( fFeeOnly )
nReturns aggregated BlockIndex data for blocks
height, height+1, height+2, ..., height+range-1]

nArguments:
1. height             (numeric, required) block height where the search starts.
2. range              (numeric, required) number of blocks to include.
3. fFeeOnly           (boolean, optional, default=False) return only fee info.
```
Result:
```

```

## Build System Changes

### New Architectures for Depends

The depends system has new added support for the `s390x` and `ppc64el` architectures. This is done in order to support the future integration with [Snapcraft](https://www.snapcraft.io), as well as to support any developers who may use systems based on such architectures.

### Basic CMake Support

While the existing Autotools based build system is our standard build system, and will continue to be so, we have added basic support for compiling with CMake on macOS and linux systems.

This is intended to be used in conjunction with IDEs like CLion (which relies heavily on CMake) in order to streamline the development process. Developers can now use, for example, CLion's internal debugger and profiling tools.

Note that it is still required to have relevant dependencies installed on the system for this to function properly.
